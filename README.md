# DormFundMe
A Javokhir Arifov, Philip Baillargeon, Caroline Gao, and Anvit Garg Production


Our sociotechnical system is a platform for dorm members to fairly suggest how a dorm should spend its given budget. At a high level, dorm members will be able to (1) propose small, medium, large, or extra large items or activities and (2) view and vote on other membersâ€™ proposals. 






For Developers: To start up the project, from the DormFundMe directory, run the following commands in the terminal
